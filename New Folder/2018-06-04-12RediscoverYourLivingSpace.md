You are coming back from travels. You’ve spent a decant amount of time away from your living space, and while doing so you have become accustomed to a different routine, different bed, different climate. 

As you approach your living space you will note familiar landmarks. Although you know them well they have a certain alien quality to them. 

Once you get to your living space go straight to your bed. Observe, the peculiar clashing of this space as it has continued to exist without your presence, and it has existed in your memory. Notice every little difference. Notice small details that did not exist in your memory. Ask yourself why it feels like the space has changed.

This activity must be arrived at purely by chance.

Loose an object, trivial or important, and know that you have lost it, but be unable to recall what you’ve lost. Fall victim to the rare simultaneous loss of an object and memory. 

This happens rarely, and it’s impossible to prepare for, but if it does, pay attention to the experience. Perhaps it happens more often then we think. We like to hide these moments from ourself.

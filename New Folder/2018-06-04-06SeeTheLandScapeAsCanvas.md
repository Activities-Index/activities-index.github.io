Find yourself in a landscape with little variety, such as the sea or country side. Gaze at it; don’t scrutinize or stare. Start to see the landscape as existing on a singular and smooth surface, like a painting or photo. Imagine that everything you see exists on an immense stretched canvas, in perfect focus and all encompassing. 

Now imagine this canvas being folded up. Picture it as a gigantic curtain, opening to reveal something. Cultivate curiosity as to what lies behind it. Feel the way in which the world is liable to slippage. 

This mindset can be brought to future landscapes.

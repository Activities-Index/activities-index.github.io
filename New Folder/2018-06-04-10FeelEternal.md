Imagine that eternity is not a belief, but a fact. To become convinced of this take a leap of faith.

Start by assuming that out existence is like a circle, with the outer edges consisting of the more material things and the inner consisting of more ephemeral. On the outermost edges lies out skin. As we venture towards the center we pass our heart and lunges, until we get to our thoughts and feelings. And then, at the core, is the fundamental essence of our being. An essence that existences independent of time, and other worldly constraints. An essence that is eternal. To meditate on this core and exist within it is this Activity.

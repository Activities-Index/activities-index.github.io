This is best to be preformed on a summer night with no clouds. Lie on your back, looking up at the stars. Become lulled by their mysterious and awe-inspiring presence. Don’t hold back, allow yourself to be entranced by the stars, taking your time. You will get the sensation that you are riveted to the earth, almost crushed by the immensity of the stars. Little by little, see the stars as below you, and yourself as an onlooker, flying over the abyss of stars.

It’s advised to do this activity alone so as to avoid ridicule. 

Find an ordinary and familiar object that you can fit in your hand, such as a pencil or glass. Take it in your hand, and repeat its name in a low voice while staring at it. In a short time this familiar and normal word will become nothing more than a meaningless and absurd series of sounds. As the word grows more and more imaginary, theoretical, the object itself becomes more and more real and present. 

Note: This activity will be familiar to many who discovered it as a child.

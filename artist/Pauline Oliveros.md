Pauline Oliveros was an American composer, accordionist and a central figure in the development of experimental and post-war electronic art music. Her "Sonic Meditations" many of which are documented in the book of the same name, are Activities that focas the participant on their relationship to sound and their environment. They are intended for group work over a long period of time with regular meetings, but can still be beneficial when performed outside of that context.

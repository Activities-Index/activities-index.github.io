Go to sea shore (Beach)

Take three stones. large or small

Place yourself on your hands and knees

Put one stone down.

Crawl forward a few feet, and place second stone down.

Crawl forward a few feet more, place third stone down.

Then crawl *back* to the first stone, pick it up.

Then turn around and crawl back past second and third stones, and place first stone a few feet in front of the thrid stone.

Then turn around and crawl back to the second stone, (which has now become the last stone) pick it up, turn around go back up the line of stones, and place that stone a bit in front of the lead stone.

In this manner you can travel down the beach...
1. until you get tired
2. until you have gone through the cycle 100 times
3. until you run into the Ocean

At that time you gather the three stones and place them into a little triangle pattern.

Then shout as loud as you can "Well that's new isn't it?"

Then throw the three stones into the Ocean. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; end

As is plain from the description of the event, it must be done with solemnity.

no stopping to bark at dogs

no altering of straight ahead course for horses or fishermen.

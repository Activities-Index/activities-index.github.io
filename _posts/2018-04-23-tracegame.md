Play this game on the sandy beach.

Play it with more than several men.

One of them walks, taking the lead, the others follow him.

The leader's trace must curve and cross itself more than ten times.

The leader must walk more than 500 meters.

Coming near the starting point, he must make a loop of his trace.

The folloerts may take any of the three courses at each crossing point, but must not return or stop.

All must move at the same tempo.

When one meets another coming from the opposite direction on the line, the two men must go off from the course.

When one man or nobody remains, the game is finished.

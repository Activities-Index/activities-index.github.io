2. Visualize your name as you sign it mentally.
  * with eyes closed
  * with eyes open
3. Visualize your name in different kinds of writing, script and printing.
  * vary the sizes from microscopic to gigantic
  * vary the colors and backg rounds
  * vary the dimensions from 2 to 3.
4. Visualize or actually sign your name backwards, forwards, upside down, inside out.
  * with the right hand

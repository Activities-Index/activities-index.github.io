Think of some familiar sound. Listen to it mentally. Try to find a metaphor for this sound. What are the real and imaginary possible contexts for this sound? How many ways does or could this sound affect you? or how do you feel about it? What is its effect upon you? How can this sound be described?

As a group meditation, sit in a circle. Find a sound common to all, then ask the above questions one by one. Allow plenty of time between each question. When all of the questions have been asked, the group shares their answers.

Variations: Try the same meditation with
1. an imaginary sound
2. a live sound
3. a remembered sound

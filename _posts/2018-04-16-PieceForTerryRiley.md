Come on the performance area dressed in a baseball catcher's uniform. Stand there for a minute to let the people see what they will hear. Smile, and say pleasantly - "I'd like you to see and hear my catcher's equipment." Then explain the functions of all of the parts of the equipment and make sounds with them. Show everything. Mask, glove, chest protector, shin guards, straps ect. Hum babe.

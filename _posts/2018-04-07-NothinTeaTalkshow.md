Wake up in the middle of the night, preferably due to natural causes (an inability to sleep).

Make a mug of "nothin' tea" by heating hot water as if to make tea, but not including a teabag. The mug should be filled with nothing but hot water.

Remove your clothes and get in a shower running at a comfortable temperature. Make sure to bring your mug of "nothin' tea".

Sit down in the shower, and talk out loud to yourself as if on a talk show dedicated to discussing your personal life. Drink the tea periodically.

Perform the entire activity in as close to pitch black as possible.

Tape record a selected environment alone or with a group. Place the microphone carefully in one locotion. Do the environmental dialogue mentally while you are recording. Reinforce everything you hear mentally. When the meditation is complete, make a translation of the environmental dialogue in the following way: Reinforce the pitches of the recorded sounds with vocal, instrumental, electronic or a combination of these sources. The resulting translation may exist in one or more channels as the translated sounds only or a combination of the translation and originol dialogue. A new dialogue is then performed in the same or a different environment with the recorded translation ond a soloist or a group, either vocal, instrumental or electronic or any combinotion. The live dialogue should include the sounds of the live environment as well as the recorded tronslation.

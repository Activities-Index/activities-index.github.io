The biggest star - Look at it while you like.

The second biggest star - Obscure it with smoke of a cigarette.

The third biggest star - Shoot it with a gun.

The fourth biggest star - Hold a cat in your arms.

The fifth biggest star - Look at it through a telescope

The sixth biggest star - When you find it, look at your watch.

The seventh biggest star - Reflect it in the water of a glass and drink it.

The eight biggest star - Obscure it with a flame of a candle.

The ninth biggest star - Draw a deep breath.

The tenth biggest star - Lie down and look it through a loop of your fingers.

The eleventh biggest star - Read a letter sent to you recently.

Put your hands finger to finger, palm to palm, level with your eyes. Separate your palms, but keep your fingers joined together. Then push, being careful to never let the palms touch.

Push sincerely, and feel the tension in your muscles as you do so. 

The situation will become kind of ambiguous. What you see with your eyes, two symmetrical hands, doesn’t correspond with the sensations the hands are reporting to experience, as if they are pushing against an inviable and immovable wall.

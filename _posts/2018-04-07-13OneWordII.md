Choose a word. Listen to it mentally. Slowly and gradually begin to voice this word by allowing each tiny part of it to sound extremely prolonged. Repeat for a long time.

Variations:
1. As above, but increase the speed of each repetition as imperceptibly as possible. Continue beyond the normal pronunciation of the word until the repetitions are as fast as possible. Continue.
2. As variation a. but when the top speed has been reached and maintained, reverse the process by slowing down again as imperceptibly as possible until the original utterance returns.

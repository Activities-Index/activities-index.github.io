<i>Informed persons should begin the greeting at least half-an-hour or more before a scheduled meeting or program.</i>

After you are seated and comfortable, allow a tone to come into mind. Keep returning your attention to this same tone. Everytime a person or persons enter this space, greet them by singing the tone as you were greeted when you entered this space. Continue this meditation until all are present.

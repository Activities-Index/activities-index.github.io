Find yourself in a restaurant or similar social gathering with loud conversation. Eavesdrop on the conversation of a group with the same number of people as your own (this activity works well with two people). Each member of your group assume the role of a member of the corresponding group. Imagine that the words coming out of your assigned person are your own. You should not try to speak or mime, but your facial expression may change with what's being said.

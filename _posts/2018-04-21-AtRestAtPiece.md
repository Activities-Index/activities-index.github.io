We all have that "one" person that we have allowed under our skin, given them a blueprint to our buttons and has learned the special dance of annoyance on out last nerve. Take two minutes and think about that person. Take another two minutes and pray for that person by name. Take another two minutes and try, with all of your being, to love that person.

Suggestion:
Repeat this every day, at least once a day, for a month and see if that changes how you feel about them.

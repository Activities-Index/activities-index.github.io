*Jesus asked us to pray for and love our enemies- even evil, vile, misguided enemies. So here it goes: May Fred Phelps' soul and the souls of all the departed rest in peace and rise in glory. Amen.*

We all have that "one" person that we have allowed under our skin, given them a blueprint to our buttons and has learned the special dance of annoyance on out last nerve. Take two minutes and think about that person. Take another two minutes and pray for that person by name. Take another two minutes and try, with all of your being, to love that person.

Suggestion:
Repeat this every day, at least once a day, for a month and see if that changes how you feel about them.

One of the more important people in the history of performance art is the artist [Allan Kaprow (1927 - 2006)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Kaprow). Kaprow is most known for establishing the artistic frameworks known as the "[Happening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happening)" and "[Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installation_art)", which have informed what we view as art, as well as the audience's relationship to art. Less known, however, is the type of art he proposed in his later years called the "Activity".

In activities, the internal experience of the performer becomes the art object, which means the creation, experience, and interpretation of the art all happens within the performer. Activities are things to be done for the sake of having the experience of having done that thing.

Kaprow is far from the only person to have been working within this line of thought. The composer Pauline Oliveros wrote a series of what she dubbed "Sonic Meditations", which are activities to be performed by a group, not for an audience but for the group.

Despite how common this type of writing and thinking is, there isn't an easily navigable, existing index dedicated to these kind of activities. Or at least there wasn't until now. The Activities Index is an ongoing project looking to catalog any and all instructions for Activities. It's a bit of a collaborative project, so if there are any Activities that you think would be appropriate for the site do submit them. The hope is that as we check back on the site in the future more Activities will be added.
